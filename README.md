# axie

This interacts with the Axie Infinity API.

You can use it to look for axies for sale in a way that's not possible
through their filter UI. For example, you can sort in descending order
by attack, defense, attack+defense, each individual stat, purity, and at
the same time you can break ties by sorting in ascending order by price.
That makes it easier to find axies that are a good deal.

You can also determine how much longer until your teams are ready for battle,
you can send a single team to battle, or you can send all the teams that are
ready off to battle at once.

## Usage

It can be used either in the REPL or at the command line.

Here are the CLI commands:

```
COMMANDS:
   teams                Show all your teams and whether they're ready to battle.
   team                 Get some info on the axies on a team.
   matches              Show your recent match history.
   start                Send all the teams that are ready off to battle.
   unassigned           Which of your axies aren't on a team?
   breedable            Which of your axies are currently breedable?
   leaderboard          Who's at the top?
   rank                 Find your rank
```

You can run them with Leiningen:

```
lein run teams

lein run matches

lein run start
```

You can also execute these commands from the REPL:

```
=> (cmd/teams)

=> (cmd/matches)

=> (cmd/start)
```

## Options

It needs to read a config file, called `.axie.conf` in the working directory.

The config file needs to contain your Ethereum address and your Axie Infinity
bearer token (which can be learned from local storage on their website, at
the key `axieinfinity.<eth-addr>.auth`).

```
{:eth-addr "<your-eth-address>"
 :token "<your-bearer-token>"}
 ```

## Examples

Find some interesting axies to buy:

```
(def all @(fetch-all))

(->> all (sort-axies [:atk+def :desc] [:price :asc]) (map search-keys) dedupe (take 4) print-table)
```

Look at some of your own axies:

```
(def mine @(fetch-my-axies))

(->> mine (sort-axies [:atk+def :desc]) (map mine-keys) (take 4) print-table)
```

Check out your teams:

```
@(md/chain (fetch-teams) print-table)
```

Start all the battles:

```
@(start-battles)
```
